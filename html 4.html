          al., 1966 Metaphyta Whittaker, 1969 Plants are the eukaryotes that
          form the kingdom Plantae; they are predominantly photosynthetic. This
          means that they obtain their energy from sunlight, using chloroplasts
          derived from endosymbiosis with cyanobacteria to produce sugars from
          carbon dioxide and water, using the green pigment chlorophyll.
          Exceptions are parasitic plants that have lost the genes for
          chlorophyll and photosynthesis, and obtain their energy from other
          plants or fungi. Most plants are multicellular, except for some green
          algae. Historically, as in Aristotle's biology, the plant kingdom
          encompassed all living things that were not animals, and included
          algae and fungi. Definitions have narrowed since then; current
          definitions exclude fungi and some of the algae. By the definition
          used in this article, plants form the clade Viridiplantae (green
          plants), which consists of the green algae and the embryophytes or
          land plants (hornworts, liverworts, mosses, lycophytes, ferns,
          conifers and other gymnosperms, and flowering plants). A definition
          based on genomes includes the Viridiplantae, along with the red algae
